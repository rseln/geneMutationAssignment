# miniAdtAssignment

Given an input, the program is meant to determine if a combination of nucleobases (ie. Cytosine, Guanine, Adenine, and Thymine) would be able to mutate in a specfic number of steps. This assignment was implemented using abstract data types (adjacency list) and the breadth first search algorithm.
